## üîç Overview

This project was created to demonstrate, in a didactic way, how to apply the most common **Design Patterns** in C#. Each pattern includes:

- **Description**: What it is and when to use it.
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step commented code.
- **Execution Example**: Console demonstration.

## üß© Implemented Patterns

### 1. Creational
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic.
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Abstract Factory**: Factory of factories for families of objects.

### 2. Structural
- **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

### 3. Behavioral
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms, making them interchangeable.
- **Observer**: Notifies dependents when a state changes.
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (optional)

### Locally

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project Program.cs
   ```

### Via Docker

1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. The terminal output will show each pattern in action.

## üöÄ Usage Example

When you run the application, you‚Äôll see something like this in the console:

```
--- Factory Method ---
Creating Product A‚Ä¶
Product A created successfully!

--- Singleton ---
Unique instance obtained: ID 1
Unique instance obtained: ID 1

--- Strategy ---
Processing with Strategy X‚Ä¶
Processing with Strategy Y‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶
```

Each block corresponds to one of the patterns implemented in `Patterns/`.
